title: Semantic Security Invariance under Variant Computational Assumptions
abstract: A game-based cryptographic proof is a relation that estab-lishes equivalence between probabilistic sequences of actions by real andideal world players. The author of a proof selects ahardness assumptionsystemfor their proof upon which to base their subsequent statements. Inthis paper, we prove the existence of proof-invariant transformations forvarying hardness assumptions. We show that for two systems satisfyingcertain algebraic properties any proof in one system has an equivalentvalid proof in the other. This validates Kurosawaâ€™s remark about theexistence of proof similarities.Our result implies a correspondence between the Learning With Errors(LWE)  problems  and  both  the  Elliptic  Curve  Discrete  Log  problem(ECDLP) and the Discrete Logarithm (DLOG) problem. To illustrate thisresult, we provide a series of example transformations in the appendix. The concrete result of this paper is a prototype proof translation tool.
