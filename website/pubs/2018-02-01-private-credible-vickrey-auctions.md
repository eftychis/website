title: 'On the possibility of Credible Vickrey Auction Mechanisms (in prep.)'
abstract: "Vickrey auctions \"in the wild\" are rare due to distrust to participants colluding. Prior work has shown that vanilla Vickrey auctions while dominant are not a credible mechanism, that is participants benefit from collusions. We show the existence of a credible Vickrey mechanism variant. We prove security of our construction against an adaptive probabilistic polynomial time adversary. Finally we prove the impossibility of a credible first price or second price auction with half or more of the participants colluding. <br> A key property of our construction is it preserves privacy of the auctioned item distribution along with the utility function of the bidders. We show that lack of the latter property is crucial in the presence of a corruptible auctioneer for any multi-round auction mechanism. Lack of the former implies bidder collusions against the auctioneer."
