I am interested in cryptographic primitives, distributed systems and
protocols and verification/formal methods thereof.

I work on security protocols, verification and logic transformations with John C. Mitchell at Stanford  Security and Theory Lab. In between, I worked as a Software Engineer responsible for the Core Security on a Distributed OS/Cloud Platform at Apcera focusing on Authentication and Distributed Key Management Mechanisms, Consensus Protocols and Policy Language. Before that I devoted my time working on distributed systems at AT&T - specifically on consensus optimization.

You can find a CV of mine [here](https://eftychis.org/cv/cv.pdf).
